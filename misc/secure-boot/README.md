# WARNING:
- This fails because
  We still need a key from the original windows setup to complete this.



# Goal
- Support dual-boot PopOS and Win-11
- Install and run sbctl to do this

# Notes:
- sbctl must be built on PopOS since there is no
  prebuilt binary for it.

# Docs:
- See https://man.archlinux.org/man/sbctl.8
